## Using This Template

[Creating a Repository From a Template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

## Renaming

To automatically replace `python_template` with the name of your instrument, run the "Rename Module Repo" GitHub Actions Workflow in your repository: [Manually Running a Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow)

N.B. this assumes your repository is named using the `<instrument_name>_module` format.

## TODO's

Throughout this module template, there are a number of comments marked `TODO`. You can use search/find and replace to help ensure you're taking full advantage of the module template.
